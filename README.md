# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the performance of students (e.g., grades, pass/fail, or score ranges) based on various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The aim is to help educators, institutions, and parents identify students at risk and take early interventions to improve learning outcomes.

## 🎯 Project Motivation
Students’ performance depends on multiple factors such as study hours, family support, attendance, and extracurricular involvement.  
By leveraging **Machine Learning models**, we can predict a student’s performance and provide actionable insights to enhance learning.

  - Demographics: Age, gender, family background  
  - Academic: Past grades, study hours, attendance  
  - Lifestyle: Free time, extracurricular activities  
  - Others: Internet access, parental education, etc.
- **Target Variable:** Final grade or performance category (e.g., High / Medium / Low)

## 📋 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gather the dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical data, normalize/scale features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand feature distributions and correlations.  
4. **Feature Selection** – Choose relevant predictors.  
5. **Model Selection & Training** – Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Compare performance metrics.  
7. **Prediction & Deployment** – Save best model and prepare for integration.

Model Training

Example training script:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('student_performance.csv')

# Preprocess (example)
X = df.drop('performance', axis=1)
y = df['performance']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'student_performance_model.pkl')

📏 Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Score (if applicable)

Example:

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

📈 Results

Best Model: RandomForestClassifier with 89% accuracy

Key Features impacting performance:

Study hours per week

Attendance rate

Past grades

Parental education level

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add deep learning models for better accuracy

Deploy model as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Include time-series tracking of student performance

Build real-time dashboards for educators
